# Organize Download files
## Introduction
You can now organize your download files in multiple ways. 
1. Create New category, and select the file types that you want them to move in (Word Documents, Spreadsheets etc)
2. For file type, only one category can be active
3. Always Create at least one Category, which has "Any file", and make it active to send any other files to it
4. If two Categories have same file type, only one of them will be active, other will be standby. (The last one activated will be active)
5. You can move the dowloaded file by
     1. Not renaming it
     2. Rename using time stamp
     3. Rename using "Category_nnnnn" where nnnn is a incrementing sequence number
6. You can check Active Categories from System Tray
7. Only if you monitor a specific folder (Download folder), it will work. It will not monitor subfolders
8. It will crreated Category folders under the monitoring folder
9. You can choose "Verbose" for alerting you on every file that is moved
